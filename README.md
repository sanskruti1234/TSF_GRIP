Data Science and Business Analytics Tasks

Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook

Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.

Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.
I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. Dataset for this model can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.

Task 3- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
